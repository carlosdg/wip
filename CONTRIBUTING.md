# Contributing guide

First of all we want to give you a BIG thank you for being willing to help this project 😊

1. Fork the repository 🍴
2. Clone it to your local environment 💻
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the tests:

   - Run `npm test`
   - Select the option to run all tests

     This way you know in what state the project is before doing any changes. Imagine that you didn't run the tests and after changing something you run the tests and they fail 😨.

     By running the test before anything you don't need to waste your afternoon in something that may not have been your fault, it could been an error that was already there or something happened forking, clonning or installing the dependencies.

5. Create a branch for your pull request
6. Add your changes
7. Run the tests
8. Commit and push to your forked project
9. Submit your pull request 😇
